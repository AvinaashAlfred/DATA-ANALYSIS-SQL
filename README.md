# DATA-ANALYSIS-SQL
Develop a comprehensive database solution for Sakila that enhances efficiency in managing, analysing, and accessing film rental information
Movie rental data analysis in SQL involves examining and extracting insights from a dataset related to movie rentals.
This data could be from a database that records customer transactions, rental details, and movie information.
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing such data. 
Movie rental data analysis in SQL can provide valuable information for businesses in the entertainment industry, including movie rental stores or streaming platforms, to make data-driven decisions and improve their services.
The Sakila Database is a commonly used sample database that provides a realistic and comprehensive schema for practicing and learning various aspects of relational database management systems (RDBMS) and SQL. It was created by the MySQL team to serve as a practical resource for developers, students, and educators who are interested in understanding database concepts and gaining hands-on experience in SQL query writing.
